In cancer research, the granularity of mutation analysis refers to the level of detail at which genetic changes within cancer cells are identified and characterized. High granularity involves analyzing mutations at a single-nucleotide level, including point mutations, insertions, deletions, and structural variations in the genome. This detailed view allows researchers to distinguish between different types of mutations and understand how each specific change can contribute to cancer progression and the development of different cancer variants. High-granularity mutation analysis is crucial for identifying specific oncogenic drivers and potential targets for personalized therapies.

By increasing the granularity of mutation analysis, researchers can uncover rare mutations and subtle genetic alterations that may not be apparent in less detailed analyses. This comprehensive approach provides a more complete picture of the tumor's genetic landscape, facilitating the identification of distinct cancer variants that may respond differently to treatment. Understanding the specific mutations present in a tumor enables the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment plans, leading to more effective interventions and improved patient outcomes. High-granularity analysis thus plays a critical role in advancing precision oncology, where treatment is tailored to the unique genetic makeup of an individual's cancer.
